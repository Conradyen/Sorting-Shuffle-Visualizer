# Shuffle-and-Shorting-Visualizer

This project implements and vasualize shuffle and sorting algorithms. The process is being split into sequence first shuffle the array than sort the array finally check if the array is sorted. You can access through https://conradyen.github.io/Sorting-Shuffle-Visualizer/. Hope you enjoy play around with this project.
